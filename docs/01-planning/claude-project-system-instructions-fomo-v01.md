## Project Setup Instructions

### Claude Project Structure

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Name: "File-Management-System"
   - Description: "A comprehensive file management framework using kebab-case and automation"

2. **Set Up Core Conversations**
   - **Main-System-Planning**: Central hub for coordination and final documents
   - **Research-and-Standards**: For convention documentation and examples
   - **Implementation-and-Automation**: For scripts, workflows, and technical solutions
   - **Special-Cases-and-Exceptions**: For handling edge cases and unique file types

3. **Artifact Naming Standards**
   - Use kebab-case for all artifact titles
   - Follow pattern: `[Document-Type]-[Description]-v[##]`
   - Example: `Guide-Naming-Standards-v01`

4. **Version Control Within Claude**
   - Use the v## suffix for all artifacts
   - Start with v01 and increment with each significant revision
   - Document changes in version history section at the bottom of artifacts
   - Use artifact updates for minor changes and create new versions for major revisions

## Documentation Creation Guidelines

### Document Structure

1. **Standard Sections for All Documents**
   - Title and version number
   - Brief introduction/purpose statement
   - Table of contents for longer documents
   - Main content with clear headings
   - Examples/illustrations
   - Version history

2. **Formatting Standards**
   - Use Markdown for all documentation
   - Organize with hierarchical headings (# for main, ## for sections)
   - Use code blocks for examples: ```example-file-name.ext```
   - Create tables for comparisons and structured information
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists for sequential instructions
   - Include diagrams where helpful (Mermaid if complex relationships)

3. **Content Guidelines**
   - Be concise but comprehensive
   - Use examples liberally
   - Include rationales for decisions
   - Anticipate questions and edge cases
   - Focus on practical application

### Using Claude's Analytics Tool

1. **File Analysis Scripts**
   - Use the Analytics Tool to create JavaScript for analyzing file structures
   - Develop code to validate naming conventions
   - Create path manipulation utilities
   - Test automation scripts before implementing

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Generate visual representations of directory structures
   - Create frequency charts of file types
   - Analyze compliance with naming conventions over time
   - Visualize before/after implementation comparisons

3. **Script Development Process**
   - Create initial script in Analytics Tool
   - Test with sample data
   - Debug and refine
   - Document with inline comments
   - Export for implementation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Automation Tool Setup

1. **Hazel Configuration**
   - Create rule sets for different folders
   - Define pattern matching for file types
   - Establish naming transformations
   - Set up sorting rules

2. **Apple Shortcuts**
   - Design shortcuts for capturing screenshots
   - Create quick rename actions
   - Develop save templates
   - Build file processing workflows

3. **Python Scripts**
   - Write batch processing scripts
   - Create validation tools
   - Develop directory organization utilities
   - Build reporting functions

4. **n8n Workflows**
   - Design cloud file management workflows
   - Create triggers for file events
   - Establish connections with other services
   - Develop automation sequences

### Design Asset Management

1. **Asset Organization**
   - Categorize assets by type (images, fonts, templates)
   - Tag assets with relevant metadata
   - Establish version control for design files
   - Create project-specific asset collections

2. **Adobe Creative Cloud Integration**
   - Configure CC Libraries to align with file system
   - Establish naming consistency across applications
   - Manage linked assets appropriately
   - Structure project files for efficient access

3. **Font Management**
   - Organize fonts by family and style
   - Document licensing information
   - Create project-specific font collections
   - Implement activation/deactivation workflow

### Death Industry Specific Considerations

1. **Sensitive Content Handling**
   - Develop protocols for confidential information
   - Create secure storage areas
   - Establish clear identification for sensitive files
   - Document retention policies

2. **Client Materials Organization**
   - Structure by client/family
   - Separate memorial types
   - Categorize by service stage
   - Include cultural/religious designations

3. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Organize legal documents
   - Track permissions and releases
   - Maintain audit trails
   - Archive according to regulations

## Testing and Evaluation

1. **Implementation Testing**
   - Verify script functionality with sample files
   - Test automation on non-critical directories first
   - Validate across different file types
   - Check compatibility with all tools and applications

2. **Usability Assessment**
   - Evaluate time required to find specific files
   - Measure cognitive load during file operations
   - Test with common workflow scenarios
   - Gather subjective feedback on the system

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track automation success rates
   - Measure system compliance over time
   - Document time savings
   - Identify areas for refinement

## Maintenance Procedures

1. **Regular Review Process**
   - Schedule weekly quick checks
   - Conduct monthly system evaluations
   - Perform quarterly standard revisions
   - Document all changes and improvements

2. **System Updates**
   - Process for updating automation rules
   - Procedure for revising standards
   - Method for implementing new features
   - Path for resolving issues

3. **Knowledge Management**
   - Update documentation with lessons learned
   - Refine cheatsheets based on usage patterns
   - Maintain a troubleshooting guide
   - Document workarounds for limitations
