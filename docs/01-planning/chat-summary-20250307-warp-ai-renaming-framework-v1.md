# AI File Renaming: Balancing Pre-developed Tools and AI Solutions

## Project Summary

We've developed a modular AI-powered file renaming system that leverages Warp Terminal's Agent Mode. The system combines pre-built utilities with AI-directed processing to intelligently rename files based on their content. The project evolved from examining existing resources like the `ai-renamer` project and Raycast script repository to identify useful utilities and approaches, then implementing our own modular toolkit with additional capabilities.

## Key Components Developed

### Core Utilities
1. **`file-utils.sh`**: File type detection and metadata extraction
   - Comprehensive file type detection based on extensions
   - Cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux)
   - File size, creation and modification dates
   - MIME type and binary detection

2. **`content-utils.sh`**: Content extraction and analysis
   - Text extraction from various formats including PDFs
   - Title and keyword extraction
   - Content similarity comparison
   - Summary generation

3. **`string-utils.sh`**: String manipulation for filenames
   - Multiple case formats (kebab, snake, camel, pascal)
   - Smart truncation preserving word boundaries
   - Filename cleaning and sanitisation
   - Common prefix detection
   - Version extraction

4. **`directory-utils.sh`**: Directory analysis and processing
   - Pattern analysis across files
   - Duplicate detection
   - Recommendations generation
   - Markdown report creation

### Integration Layer
1. **`rename-utils.sh`**: Coordinating logic for renaming operations
   - Safe rename operations with backup options
   - Collision detection and resolution
   - AI-suggested filename generation
   - Batch directory processing

2. **`ai-integration.sh`**: AI model interaction
   - Prompt template management
   - Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Response parsing and formatting
   - Simulation mode for testing

### Command-line Interface
1. **`ai-rename.sh`**: Main user-facing script
   - Comprehensive command-line options
   - Clear user feedback with colours
   - Progress reporting
   - Dry-run capability

2. **`config.sh`**: Configuration management
   - JSON-based configuration
   - Default settings with user overrides
   - Command-line and file-based configuration
   - Configuration reset and display

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component focuses on a specific aspect, allowing flexibility and easier maintenance

2. **Shell Script Naming Convention**: Standardised on kebab-case with `-utils.sh` suffix for all utility scripts
   - Consistent with Unix/Linux conventions
   - Command-line friendly (no escaping needed)
   - Better readability with clear word boundaries

3. **Balanced Approach to AI Integration**:
   - Pre-built utilities handle common operations efficiently
   - AI focuses on content analysis and intelligent naming decisions
   - Simulation mode allows testing without API dependencies

4. **Safety-First Design**:
   - Backup capabilities before making changes
   - Dry-run mode to preview changes
   - Collision detection and resolution strategies
   - Detailed logging

5. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   - Content comparison to identify duplicates
   - Multiple resolution approaches (numbering, content-based, datetime)
   - Preservation of important naming elements

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Built-in Testing**:
   - Each script includes a self-test when run directly
   - Test cases for core functionality
   - Edge case handling

2. **Robustness Features**:
   - Dependency checking
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Graceful error handling

## Implementation Phases Completed

1. **Phase 1**: Core utilities development
   - Basic file operations
   - String manipulation
   - Content extraction
   - Directory analysis

2. **Phase 2**: Integration layer
   - Rename operations coordination
   - AI integration
   - Configuration management

3. **Phase 3**: Command-line interface
   - User-friendly script
   - Comprehensive options
   - Documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Create test suites with diverse file collections
   - Validate the integration between modules
   - Measure performance with large directories

2. **Documentation**:
   - User guides with examples
   - Technical references
   - Troubleshooting section

3. **Feature Extensions**:
   - Support for additional file types
   - Enhanced AI prompt engineering
   - Workflow integration with other tools

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Visual feedback enhancements
   - Progress tracking for large operations
   - Summary reports

## Learning and Insights

1. **Existing Resources**: Significant value in examining existing tools before building from scratch

2. **AI Integration Considerations**:
   - Balance between AI capabilities and predictable utilities
   - Structured prompting for consistent results
   - Context-awareness in file analysis

3. **Modular Design Benefits**:
   - Easier testing and debugging
   - Flexible integration options
   - Progressive enhancement possibilities

4. **File System Complexities**:
   - Naming collisions require sophisticated handling
   - Cross-platform considerations
   - Safe file operations are critical

5. **Naming Conventions Matter**:
   - Consistent conventions improve usability
   - Context-aware naming improves organisation
   - Pattern detection enhances batch operations

This project demonstrates a successful approach to creating AI-enhanced tooling that combines the reliability of traditional utilities with the intelligence of modern AI models. The modular design allows for future expansion while maintaining a solid foundation of core functionality.
