# Claude Guide for Personal Naming Conventions Projects

## Introduction

This guide provides a practical framework for managing your naming conventions project with Claude. By adapting project management principles to Claude's capabilities, you can create a structured, efficient workflow that helps you develop, implement, and maintain consistent naming standards across your personal or small-scale projects.

Traditional approaches to naming conventions often involve scattered documentation and inconsistent implementation. By using Claude's conversational, artifact-based approach, you can create a more cohesive system that evolves with your needs while maintaining clarity and consistency.

### Why Use Claude for Naming Conventions

Claude offers unique advantages for developing naming standards:

- **Centralised documentation** through persistent artifacts
- **Interactive testing** of naming patterns and rules
- **Immediate feedback** on proposed conventions
- **Version tracking** as your standards evolve
- **Code generation** for automation scripts and tooling

This guide will help you harness these capabilities through practical, straightforward approaches that work well for individual implementers while maintaining flexibility for potential collaboration.

## Project Setup

### Basic Project Organisation

For a personal naming conventions project, a simple but intentional structure creates clarity without unnecessary complexity:

**Project Structure:**

* **Main Conversation**: Your primary thread for developing naming principles and standards
* **Implementation Conversation**: For creating automation tools and scripts
* **Testing Conversation**: For validating conventions against real examples
* **Reference Materials**: For storing relevant research and examples

**Naming Convention:**

Follow a consistent pattern for your project elements:

* Project: `naming-conventions-[scope]`
* Conversations: `naming-[purpose]`
* Artifacts: `naming-[type]-v[##].[ext]`

**Example: Personal Project Structure**

```
PROJECT: naming-conventions-personal

MAIN CONVERSATION: "naming-standards"
- Initial discussion of core principles and needs
- Regular refinements of the standards

SUPPORTING CONVERSATIONS:
- "naming-implementation" (for scripts and tools)
- "naming-testing" (for validation against examples)

REFERENCE MATERIALS:
- Existing file systems to analyse
- Industry standard examples

CORE ARTIFACTS:
- "naming-standards-v01.md" (main documentation)
- "naming-validator-v01.py" (validation script)
```

**Why This Matters**: Even for a personal project, clear organisation prevents confusion as your naming conventions evolve. It helps you maintain focus on different aspects (principles vs. implementation) and creates natural breakpoints in your workflow.

## Working with Claude

### Maintaining Context

Even in personal projects, maintaining context helps ensure consistency across sessions and prevents repeating the same ground.

**Simple Context Approaches:**

* **Summary Statements**: Begin new sessions with brief summaries of previous work
* **Artifact References**: Reference specific documents you've created
* **Decision Notes**: Maintain notes on key decisions and their rationales

**Example: Context Statement**

```
"Let's continue working on our naming conventions. In our last session,
we established kebab-case as our standard for files and directories,
with specific patterns for versioning (v01, v02) as documented in
'naming-standards-v01.md'. Today I'd like to focus on creating validation
rules for these patterns."
```

### Using Artifacts Effectively

Artifacts serve as the persistent documentation and tools for your naming conventions project.

**Key Artifacts for Naming Conventions:**

* **Standards Document** (`naming-standards-v##.md`): Your core reference
* **Validation Scripts** (`naming-validator-v##.py`): Tools to check compliance
* **Pattern Library** (`naming-patterns-v##.md`): Example patterns for different use cases
* **Migration Scripts** (`naming-migration-v##.sh`): Tools for updating existing files

**Example: Standards Document Evolution**

```
naming-standards-v01.md: Initial principles and basic patterns
naming-standards-v02.md: Added directory structure recommendations
naming-standards-v03.md: Incorporated file type-specific patterns
```

**Creating Effective Standards Artifacts:**

1. Start with core principles (clarity, consistency, brevity)
2. Document specific formats with examples and rationales
3. Include sections for different file/directory types
4. Add implementation guidance for practical use

## Implementation Workflows

### Personal Workflow Patterns

Simplified workflows help you move from concept to implementation with minimal overhead.

**Standard Workflows:**

* **Development Workflow**: Establish → Document → Test → Refine
* **Implementation Workflow**: Audit → Plan → Create Tools → Apply
* **Maintenance Workflow**: Review → Update → Test → Document

**Example: Development Workflow**

```
1. Establish - Define core principles for your naming conventions
   "I need consistent, readable names that work across my projects"

2. Document - Create initial standards document
   Create artifact: "naming-standards-v01.md"

3. Test - Apply to sample fileset
   "Let's test these patterns against my existing project files"

4. Refine - Update based on practical challenges
   "I've found hyphen-based names work better than underscores"
```

### Analytics and Testing

Use Claude's analytics capabilities to test and validate your naming conventions.

**Simple Testing Approaches:**

1. **Pattern Matching**: Test naming patterns against sample filenames
2. **Compliance Checking**: Validate directories against your standards
3. **Readability Analysis**: Evaluate clarity and scannability

**Example: Pattern Matching Test**

```javascript
// Test naming convention patterns against sample files
const fileNames = [
  "project-report-v01.docx",
  "meeting-notes-20250225.md",
  "logo_primary.svg",  // Non-compliant
  "UserProfile.tsx"    // Special case
];

const patterns = {
  standard: /^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*-v[0-9]{2}\.[a-z]+$/,
  dated: /^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*-[0-9]{8}\.[a-z]+$/,
  component: /^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-z]+$/  // Special case for React
};

// Check compliance
fileNames.forEach(file => {
  const isStandard = patterns.standard.test(file);
  const isDated = patterns.dated.test(file);
  const isComponent = patterns.component.test(file);
  const isCompliant = isStandard || isDated || isComponent;
  
  console.log(`${file}: ${isCompliant ? 'Compliant' : 'Non-compliant'}`);
  if (!isCompliant) {
    console.log(`  Suggestion: ${suggestCorrectName(file)}`);
  }
});
```

## Iteration and Improvement

### Personal Feedback Cycles

Establish simple iteration approaches to refine your naming conventions over time.

**Iteration Types:**

* **Usage-Based**: Refinements based on practical application
* **Tool-Based**: Improvements to automation and validation
* **Scope-Based**: Expanding conventions to new file types or projects

**Example: Usage-Based Iteration**

```
Initial Version:
1. Create "naming-standards-v01.md" with basic patterns
2. Apply to personal project
3. Note challenges with version numbering

Iteration:
1. Update to create "naming-standards-v02.md"
2. Revise version format from "v1" to "v01"
3. Test against same project
4. Document improvement in practical sorting
```

### Tracking Improvements

Maintain simple tracking of your naming convention evolution.

**Change Log Approach:**

Create a simple changelog section in your standards document:

```markdown
## Changelog

### v03 (25/02/2025)
- Added patterns for configuration files
- Improved directory structure guidance
- Updated validation script

### v02 (15/01/2025)
- Standardised version format to use leading zeros (v01)
- Added date format standards (YYYYMMDD)
- Created pattern library for common use cases

### v01 (01/12/2024)
- Initial standards document
- Established core principles
- Defined basic file naming patterns
```

## Implementation Tools

### Creating Practical Tools

Develop simple tools to help implement and maintain your naming conventions.

**Essential Tools:**

* **Validation Script**: Check compliance with your standards
* **Renaming Utility**: Help convert existing files to new conventions
* **Git Hooks**: Prevent non-compliant file commits
* **IDE Settings**: Configure development environments to support conventions

**Example: Simple Python Validator**

```python
import os
import re
import sys

# Define patterns from your naming conventions
patterns = {
    'standard': re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*-v[0-9]{2}\.[a-z]+$'),
    'dated': re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*-[0-9]{8}\.[a-z]+$'),
    'react': re.compile(r'^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[tj]sx$')
}

# Directories to exclude
excludes = ['.git', 'node_modules', 'venv']

def is_compliant(filename):
    # Check if file matches any valid pattern
    for pattern_name, pattern in patterns.items():
        if pattern.match(filename):
            return True, pattern_name
    return False, None

def check_directory(path):
    issues = []
    
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        # Skip excluded directories
        dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in excludes]
        
        for filename in files:
            compliant, pattern = is_compliant(filename)
            if not compliant:
                issues.append({
                    'file': os.path.join(root, filename),
                    'issue': 'Non-compliant filename'
                })
    
    return issues

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_dir = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else '.'
    issues = check_directory(target_dir)
    
    if issues:
        print(f"Found {len(issues)} non-compliant files:")
        for issue in issues:
            print(f"- {issue['file']}: {issue['issue']}")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("All files comply with naming conventions!")
        sys.exit(0)
```

### Implementation Planning

Create a simple plan for rolling out your naming conventions.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Audit**: Analyse current file naming practices
2. **Documentation**: Finalise naming standards document
3. **Tooling**: Create validation and conversion tools
4. **Testing**: Validate against test directories
5. **Rollout**: Apply to new files and gradually update existing ones
6. **Monitoring**: Regular compliance checks

**Example: Personal Implementation Timeline**

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

1. Week 1: Finalise standards document (naming-standards-v01.md)
2. Week 1: Create validation script (naming-validator-v01.py)
3. Week 2: Set up Git hooks for new projects
4. Week 2: Configure VS Code settings
5. Weeks 3-4: Gradually rename existing files in priority order:
   - Active project files first
   - Critical documentation second
   - Archived/reference projects as time permits
6. Ongoing: Monthly compliance check using validator script
```

## Best Practices

### Personal Project Best Practices

These consolidated best practices focus on practical approaches for individual implementation:

**Planning and Setup:**
* Start with clear principles before diving into specific rules
* Create simple, memorable patterns that you can apply consistently
* Document standards in a central, versioned file
* Include the "why" behind each convention, not just the "what"

**Implementation:**
* Automate validation to reduce manual checking
* Set up tooling in your daily workflow (Git hooks, IDE settings)
* Apply gradually to existing files to avoid disruption
* Test conventions against real-world examples before finalising

**Maintenance:**
* Review standards after each major project for potential improvements
* Keep a changelog of modifications to track evolution
* Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
* Create shortcuts or templates for common naming patterns

**Practical Considerations:**
* Balance ideal conventions with practical constraints
* Plan for special cases (third-party files, legacy systems)
* Document exceptions clearly with rationales
* Consider searchability and sort order in pattern design
