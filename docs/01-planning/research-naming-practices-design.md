# File management best practices for designers


December 10, 2020 | Reading Time: 6 mins

Let’s face it, file management isn’t sexy. *I’ll get to it later*, we lie to ourselves. By the end of a project, your pile of design files has grown into a hot dumpster fire. But taking the time to organize your folder structure at the beginning of a project can increase productivity and help you keep your sanity when deadlines get tight.

So how should you approach your folder structure? What should you avoid? Let’s get started.

![designer file management](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/designer-file-management.png)

### Why File Management is Important

Imagine this scenario. A client has requested a change to an older project and needs it ASAP. You locate the project folder only to find a mess of files and missing links with multiple versions labelled “final”. *If it’s final, why are there ten of them?*

Sound familiar? Better file management and organization leads to greater efficiency. In addition to keeping your head on straight, you will:

- Become a more productive designer
- Look more professional
- Feel less stressed
- Be your team’s favourite designer

#### You’ll Become a More Productive Designer

Opening an old project only to discover missing links, fonts, and files can really disrupt your workflow. It’s not only frustrating for you and collaborating designers, but you lose time that otherwise would be spent on client work. Fewer scavenger hunts means increased productivity.

#### You’ll Look More Professional

Think about that person walking into a job interview with messy hair and a wrinkly shirt. Now imagine someone that’s well dressed, clean-cut, and put together. It’s obvious which one looks more competent and professional. Your file management is no different. If your file and folder structure looks like a virtual hurricane blew through, you’re communicating to others that you’re unorganized, lazy, and likely overwhelmed.

#### You’ll Feel Less Stressed

Think about your files and folders like your house. When it’s upside down and disorderly, it impacts your mood. You get stressed not knowing where things are, making more of a mess just to find what you’re looking for. When it’s tidy, you can relax knowing things are organized.

#### Your Team Will Love You

What happens when a client requests changes to a file but you’re out on vacation? If you work with an agency, team members will need access to your work at *some* point. So again, thinking of your file structure as a house — you want it to be clean for when friends and family show up unannounced. Having a well-managed file system will make it effortless for team members to find the right file so they can get in and out like a ninja.

## The Stryve System

Generally, this is how I break down my folders. Not every client will be the same so they may have different subfolders based on projects. With organization being the goal, you don’t want to create so many folders that it takes forever to click through them. At the same time, you want to avoid having a pile of files in a single area. Treat this as a solid foundation to work from and then mould it to what works best for you.

- Work Folder
- Client Folders
- Project Folders
- File Folders

#### Work Folder and Client Folders

First, create a **Work Folder** to separate your work files from your personal files. Inside your work folder will be **Client Folders**. Whether you’re working for an agency or doing freelance, you’ll have multiple clients so it’s important to have dedicated folders for each as seen below.

#### ![Example of work and client folder structure](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/work-client-folders.png)Project Folder

Next, you’ll want to create **Project Folders** within each **Client Folder**. I recommend starting with numeric labels so projects are in order of when they were created (ie. 01 Project, 02 Project, 03 Project). When it comes to similar project types, you’ll want to be descriptive with your folder naming. “Facebook Ad” is good, but “Dundi Awards Facebook Ad” is better.

Taking this one step further, try creating a project folder dedicated to similar project types. If a client has multiple social campaigns they’ll add up to a lot of project folders over time. By grouping similar project types together, your folders will be tidier and easier to navigate.

![Example of project folders structure](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/project-folder.png)In each **Project Folder**, you’ll have a subfolder called **Brand Assets**. This is where you’ll keep files associated with the client’s brand. This includes logo files, photos, brand guidelines, etc. Label this folder with “00” at the beginning so it’s always at the top of your client folder for easy and quick access.

#### File Folders

This is where we drill down into the specifics of a **Project Folder,** which will help keep your individual projects organized while designing them. Here’s the breakdown:

**Design:** Place all your design files here (Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign etc.).  
**Resources:** This is where your images, vectors, fonts, and other design elements will go.  
**Proofs:** All of your client’s proofs will be placed here including any feedback they may provide back to you.  
**Production:** This is where all your approved deliverables will be placed. It’s recommended that you package your deliverables so the final project is contained in one area with all of the necessary files.

### ![Example of the file folders within the project folders](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/file-folders-001.png)

### Naming Files and Saving Revisions

Now that you’ve got a sense of order with your folders, the next important thing is how you save your files.

Whenever I create a new file I always begin with the initials or short form of the client I’m working on. This gives your design file easy identification if you’re doing a search or deciphering between two files with the same name. In this case, I’ve used the letters “DUNM” for Dunder Mifflin. You can check out my blog on [Creating a logo package for your client](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/blog/creating-a-logo-package-for-your-client/) to see additional examples on file naming.

![A visual breakdown of our file naming system](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/name-structure.png)

Next is the project name, followed by the latest version of your design. It’s best to avoid saving overtop of your original. Each time I make a significant change, I’ll create a new version. You never know if you’ll need to revert back to your original design so it’s best to keep older work.

But sometimes your client will change their mind and go back to a previous version to move forward with. To account for this, I always make sure my last version has the most recent approved changes. So if I have three versions and the client wants to make changes to version 2, I’ll make a copy and rename it as version 4. Why? Two reasons. First, it’s always best to keep all of your previous work in case you need to return to it. Second, if I’m returning to a project weeks later, I’ll always know that the latest version is the most up to date.

![Example of design file revision naming system](https://www.stryvemarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/file-revisions.png)

### Use the Cloud

One last thing. We recommend you invest in a cloud service for managing your files. Working from a local drive is convenient, but it can also be risky. If your computer is stolen or dies out of nowhere, countless hours of client work could be lost and sensitive information can be accessed.

Using a cloud service like Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint allows you to retrieve files from any computer and protects you from those unfortunate scenarios. If you work with a team, it’s easy to share and access shared files amongst everyone. You can even invite clients to shared folders as a way to collaborate during projects.

Taking that extra time to set your folder up at the start can feel like a drag. However, if you make it a habit you’ll make that time up quickly. To get you started, you can **download my pre-made client folder structure:**

# File naming best practices for design teams

Act as a **digital asset manager specialising in the design industry** and provide a comprehensive, evidence-based guide to file naming best practices for design teams (e.g., graphic, UX/UI, industrial). Focus on clarity, collaboration, and version control. Provide your response in AU English spelling

File naming conventions are a foundational element of effective digital asset management that often goes overlooked until chaos ensues. For design teams juggling multiple projects, versions, and collaborators, a robust file naming system is not merely an organisational nicety but a critical workflow component. Research indicates that well-implemented naming conventions can dramatically reduce search time, minimise errors, streamline collaboration, and enhance professional credibility with clients. This comprehensive guide examines evidence-based approaches to file naming specifically tailored for graphic, UX/UI, and industrial design teams, providing actionable strategies that balance clarity, flexibility, and version control while maintaining team-wide consistency.

## The Critical Importance of File Naming Conventions in Design

File naming conventions serve as the invisible infrastructure supporting design operations, facilitating efficient retrieval and management of digital assets in increasingly complex project environments. Without standardised naming protocols, design teams frequently encounter frustrating scenarios such as working on outdated versions, accidentally overwriting critical files, or spending excessive time hunting for specific assets across poorly organised storage systems[^1][^6]. These inefficiencies not only waste valuable creative time but can lead to significant quality control issues, particularly when preparing deliverables for clients or production teams. The consequences of poor file organisation extend beyond mere inconvenience; they directly impact project timelines, team collaboration, and ultimately, the professional reputation of both individual designers and the organisation as a whole[^1][^7].

The implementation of structured naming conventions delivers multiple tangible benefits that directly address these challenges in the design workflow. Properly named files dramatically improve searchability, allowing team members to quickly locate assets without manually opening multiple documents or relying on memory[^8]. This enhanced searchability becomes increasingly valuable as project archives grow over time, particularly when revisiting past work for inspiration or repurposing existing assets for new projects. Furthermore, clear naming conventions facilitate smoother communication both internally and with external stakeholders, establishing a common vocabulary that everyone can understand regardless of their direct involvement in the creation process[^6]. When clients or team members can easily identify the latest version of a logo or user interface mockup without confusion, it reflects positively on the team's professionalism and attention to detail[^1][^7].

Perhaps most importantly for design teams specifically, consistent file naming creates an implicit version control system that preserves design history and prevents accidental loss of work. The iterative nature of design means that multiple versions of a single asset often exist simultaneously, representing different directions, client feedback implementations, or stages of refinement[^3][^9]. Without clear delineation between these versions through systematic naming, teams risk losing valuable iterations or confusing similar but distinct versions, potentially undermining client confidence when the wrong version is presented or implemented. A thoroughly implemented naming system essentially creates a navigable timeline of design development that supports not only present workflow but future reference and learning opportunities[^11].

## Core Principles of Effective File Naming

The foundation of any successful file naming system begins with a balance between brevity and descriptiveness—a principle that seems contradictory but is achievable through thoughtful convention design. File names should be concise enough to be quickly scanned and understood, yet contain sufficient information to distinguish them from similar files without requiring them to be opened[^4][^5]. This delicate balance requires designers to ruthlessly prioritise which information is truly essential to include in the filename itself versus what can be communicated through folder structure or metadata. When constructing these conventions, design teams should remember that overly complex or lengthy naming systems often fall into disuse precisely because they become cumbersome to implement consistently, defeating their original purpose of improving efficiency[^12].

The technical aspects of file naming deserve careful consideration, as they directly impact file system compatibility and searchability across platforms. Alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) form the safest foundation for filenames, while special characters should generally be avoided as they can cause errors in certain operating systems or when files are transferred between platforms[^4][^5]. Spaces within filenames, while seemingly intuitive, can create issues in some environments and should be replaced with underscores or hyphens as consistent delimiters[^4]. The choice between camelCase (firstWordSecondWord) and kebab-case (first-word-second-word) formats should be standardised across all files within a system—each has advantages, but consistency trumps the specific choice[^14]. These technical decisions may seem minor but can significantly impact how smoothly files integrate with various software tools and platforms used in the design workflow.

Consistency represents perhaps the most critical principle underpinning effective file naming conventions, extending beyond mere formatting to encompass vocabulary, abbreviations, and information hierarchy. Using standardised terminology throughout all filenames creates a unified system that becomes second nature to team members over time[^11]. For example, deciding whether to use "logo," "logotype," or "brandmark" consistently across all related files prevents confusion and improves searchability. Similarly, establishing consistent abbreviations for common terms (such as "ui" for user interface or "3d" for three-dimensional elements) reduces filename length while maintaining clarity[^5]. The consistent ordering of information within filenames—whether placing date first, project code first, or client name first—creates predictable patterns that make scanning directories and search results significantly more efficient[^4][^6].

## Structuring Your File Names: Components and Organisation

The architecture of an effective filename consists of carefully selected components arranged in a logical sequence that prioritises the most important identifying information. While specific needs vary across design disciplines and organisations, certain core components consistently prove valuable in design contexts[^7][^10]. Project or client identifiers serve as primary markers, immediately placing a file within its broader context and enabling quick filtering when working across multiple projects simultaneously. These identifiers might be client name abbreviations, internal project codes, or product names, depending on organisational preferences and the nature of design work being performed[^7][^13]. Following this primary identifier, descriptive elements that specify the file's content or purpose provide the next layer of information, distinguishing between different asset types within the same project (e.g., "homepage," "logo," "packaging")[^5][^13].

Date information represents a crucial component in design filenames, serving both chronological organisation and version tracking functions. The internationally recognised format of YYYYMMDD (for example, 20250303 for 3 March 2025) ensures files sort chronologically when arranged alphabetically, eliminating confusion between different international date formats[^4][^11]. This standardised date format proves particularly valuable for deadline-driven design projects, presentations, or when reviewing the progression of concepts over time. Some teams choose to incorporate both creation dates and modification dates in complex projects, though this approach requires careful implementation to avoid excessive filename length[^11]. The position of date information within the filename should reflect its importance to retrieval—files primarily organised by timeline might place date first, while those organised by project might place date later in the name structure[^4].

File type or category designations within filenames help instantly identify the nature and purpose of different assets, streamlining workflows that involve multiple file formats or design elements. These designations might indicate whether a file contains a mockup, wireframe, prototype, production-ready asset, or supporting documentation[^14]. For design firms working across multiple disciplines, these indicators help differentiate between print designs, digital assets, environmental graphics, or other specialised outputs. Similarly, purpose indicators might distinguish between files intended for client presentation, internal review, production output, or archival reference[^8][^10]. These categorical elements create natural groupings within directories and search results, allowing team members to quickly identify relevant files without opening them or relying entirely on file extensions to determine content type.

## Mastering Version Control Through Naming Conventions

Version control represents one of the most challenging aspects of file management for design teams, given the inherently iterative nature of the creative process and the frequent need for client review cycles. A robust versioning system embedded within filenames provides an accessible method for tracking iterations without requiring specialised version control software, though such tools can certainly complement good naming practices[^9][^11]. The simplest and most widely adopted approach involves sequential numbering of versions (v1, v2, v3), with the important caveat that single-digit numbers should be formatted with leading zeros (v01, v02, v03) to ensure proper numerical sorting in file systems[^4][^15]. This straightforward system allows anyone to immediately identify the most recent version of any design asset, reducing confusion and preventing work on outdated files.

For more complex design projects requiring multiple revision rounds, a two-tiered numbering system offers greater precision in tracking both major and minor changes. In this approach, whole numbers typically represent significant revisions or milestone versions (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0), while decimal increments indicate smaller iterations or refinements between major versions (v1.1, v1.2, etc.)[^11]. This granularity proves particularly valuable when managing client feedback cycles, allowing teams to track specific change implementations while maintaining a clear version history. Some teams further enhance this system by incorporating brief identifiers that indicate the reason for the version change, such as "v02_clientfeedback" or "v03_colourrevision," though care must be taken to maintain reasonable filename lengths when using this approach[^7][^9].

Perhaps the most important versioning principle for design teams specifically is avoiding the treacherous "_final" suffix, which invariably proves to be anything but final. The search results specifically highlight this as a cursed practice that inevitably leads to absurdities like "logo_final_final_REALLYFINAL"[^3][^9]. Instead of this problematic approach, maintaining consistent version numbering throughout the entire project lifecycle provides clearer tracking, even after client approval or project completion. When truly final versions need designation, approaches such as "v04_approved" or adding a project stage indicator like "v03_production" offer more sustainable alternatives that maintain versioning integrity while clearly marking milestone versions[^9][^11]. This discipline in version naming prevents the confusion that often arises when multiple "final" versions exist, particularly when projects are revisited after periods of inactivity.

## Implementation Strategies for Design Teams

Successfully implementing file naming conventions requires strategic planning and systematic rollout procedures to ensure team-wide adoption and consistency. The establishment of comprehensive documentation detailing the chosen conventions serves as a crucial foundation, creating a single source of truth that team members can reference when questions arise[^2][^6]. This documentation should include not only the rules themselves but also the rationale behind specific choices, examples demonstrating proper implementation across various file types, and clear guidance for edge cases that might arise in specific projects[^7][^14]. The documentation should be easily accessible to all team members, whether stored in a shared location, incorporated into broader design system documentation, or integrated into project templates and onboarding materials to ensure new team members adopt consistent practices from day one.

Training represents a critical component of successful implementation, transforming abstract conventions into practical habits that become second nature within the team's workflow. Initial training sessions should cover both the technical aspects of the naming system and the underlying principles that guide it, helping team members understand not just how to name files but why specific approaches have been chosen[^6][^7]. These sessions benefit from practical exercises using realistic examples relevant to the team's work, allowing designers to practice applying the conventions to their own files. Beyond initial training, periodic refreshers and reviews of the system help address any drift in practice that might occur over time and provide opportunities to refine the conventions based on practical experience and emerging needs[^7]. Throughout this process, emphasising the tangible benefits of consistent naming—such as time saved searching for files or avoiding version confusion—helps motivate adherence to the system.

The assignment of specific roles and responsibilities greatly enhances the consistency and longevity of file naming practices across design teams. Designating a file naming "champion" or steward provides a central point of expertise and accountability, ensuring someone maintains oversight of the system and can address questions or issues that arise[^7]. This role might include periodic audits of file repositories to identify inconsistencies, providing guidance to team members struggling with implementation, and recommending refinements to the conventions as team needs evolve. For larger organisations, embedding file naming responsibility within project management or creative direction roles ensures naming conventions remain integrated with broader workflow processes and receive appropriate attention during project planning and execution[^7][^10]. This accountability framework transforms file naming from an afterthought into a valued component of professional practice within the design team.

## Integrating with Digital Asset Management Systems

Modern design workflows increasingly incorporate specialised Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems that complement and enhance manual file naming practices through automation and metadata enrichment. These systems provide powerful search capabilities that extend beyond filename-based retrieval, though well-structured filenames remain valuable even within sophisticated DAM environments[^2][^8]. When implementing file naming conventions alongside DAM solutions, teams should consider how filenames interact with metadata fields, search algorithms, and automated workflows within the system[^8]. Thoughtfully designed filenames that follow consistent patterns enable more effective automated tagging, version tracking, and asset categorisation within DAM platforms, creating a synergistic relationship between manual naming practices and technological asset management tools.

The integration of automated tools for file naming can significantly improve consistency while reducing the cognitive burden on design team members, particularly for high-volume asset production. Simple automation might include filename templates built into project folder structures or save dialogues, while more sophisticated approaches might involve scripts or applications that generate compliant filenames based on project parameters and user inputs[^6][^8]. Some design teams successfully implement dropdown menus or structured fields for filename generation, ensuring that all created files automatically follow established conventions without requiring designers to remember complex rules. These automation strategies prove particularly valuable for organisations with strict compliance requirements or those managing large asset libraries where consistent naming directly impacts operational efficiency.

Folder structures represent an essential complement to filename conventions, creating a hierarchical organisation that reduces the informational burden placed on individual filenames. Well-designed folder hierarchies enable simpler filenames by establishing context through their location within the structure, allowing certain information to be implied rather than explicitly stated in every filename[^4][^7][^10]. For example, files within a folder clearly marked for a specific client need not repeat the client name in each filename, while those in a "Production" folder might not need explicit production status indicators. However, care should be taken to balance folder structure with filename content, ensuring files remain identifiable even when viewed outside their folder context, such as in search results or when attached to communications[^10][^12]. The most effective systems create logical nesting patterns that mirror project structures while avoiding excessively deep hierarchies that can hamper navigation and file retrieval.

## Collaboration and Communication Considerations

Effective file naming becomes particularly crucial in collaborative design environments where multiple team members work on shared assets across different stages of the design process. Beyond basic identification, filenames in collaborative contexts often need to communicate ownership, responsibility, and workflow status to support smooth handoffs between team members[^6][^7]. Some organisations incorporate designer initials within filenames or as prefixes/suffixes to working files, creating clear accountability and facilitating communication about specific versions[^10][^11]. This practice proves especially valuable during intensive collaborative periods when multiple team members might be iterating on related files simultaneously. However, these identifiers should follow consistent patterns and might be removed from "official" versions placed in shared repositories to maintain clean filenaming for final deliverables.

Client-facing aspects of file naming deserve special consideration, as these names often become visible during review processes and can influence perceptions of professionalism and attention to detail. Files shared with clients should maintain absolute clarity while avoiding internal terminology, excessive technical details, or abbreviated codes that might cause confusion for those outside the design team[^1][^6]. Many organisations develop simplified naming conventions specifically for client-facing files that emphasise content description and version tracking while minimising internal process information. Additionally, establishing clear expectations with clients regarding file naming and version tracking helps prevent confusion during review cycles and ensures everyone references the same versions during discussions[^9]. This client-oriented approach to file naming represents an often overlooked aspect of client service that can significantly improve communication efficiency and professional impression.

The internationalisation of design work introduces additional considerations for file naming conventions in global teams or when working with international clients. Character encoding issues can arise when filenames contain language-specific characters, potentially causing technical problems when files are shared across different systems or regions[^4][^5]. Teams working across multiple languages should establish conventions that remain functional and meaningful regardless of the user's primary language, typically relying on alphanumeric characters and widely recognised abbreviations. Similarly, date formats should follow the international standard (YYYYMMDD) rather than regional variations to prevent confusion when team members or clients are located in different countries[^4][^11]. These internationalisation considerations become increasingly important as design teams collaborate across global offices or serve multinational client bases.

## Conclusion

The implementation of robust file naming conventions represents a foundational element of professional design practice that delivers substantial benefits in efficiency, collaboration, and quality control. Through careful planning and consistent application, design teams can develop naming systems that balance descriptiveness with usability, providing clear identification while supporting effective version tracking and asset management. The evidence clearly demonstrates that well-structured file naming reduces time wasted searching for assets, prevents costly errors from working with incorrect versions, and enhances both internal and client-facing communication about design deliverables[^1][^6][^7]. These efficiency gains compound over time, transforming what might initially seem like a minor administrative concern into a significant competitive advantage through improved workflow and reduced friction in design processes.

The most successful file naming implementations share certain fundamental characteristics regardless of specific organisational needs or design disciplines. They maintain consistent structural patterns that become intuitive to team members through regular use, balancing brevity with sufficient description to make files immediately identifiable[^4][^5][^12]. They incorporate version control mechanisms that clearly track the evolution of design assets through iterative development and feedback cycles[^9][^11]. Perhaps most importantly, they receive ongoing support through documentation, training, and assigned responsibilities that ensure conventions remain relevant and consistently applied as teams and projects evolve[^6][^7]. These core principles provide a foundation for developing tailored conventions that address the specific requirements of different design teams while maintaining the fundamental benefits of organised, accessible file management.

As design workflows continue to evolve with increasingly complex digital toolsets and collaborative methodologies, file naming conventions must similarly adapt while preserving their essential functions. Integration with digital asset management systems, automated naming tools, and version control software represents the future direction for many design teams, creating hybrid approaches that combine the accessibility of clear manual naming with the power of technological assistance[^6][^8]. However, even as these technical solutions advance, the fundamental principles of clear, consistent, and meaningful file naming remain relevant as a human-centred approach to information management. By investing in thoughtful file naming conventions today, design teams establish not only immediate workflow improvements but also a sustainable foundation for managing increasingly complex digital assets throughout their lifecycle.
