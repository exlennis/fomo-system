# FOMO Project Management Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a streamlined framework for managing your FOMO (File Organisation & Management Organisation) project with Claude, focusing on maintaining organisation, context, and momentum throughout your project lifecycle. By adapting project management principles to your specific file management needs, you'll transform Claude from a simple conversational assistant into your sophisticated project management partner.

The FOMO project aims to establish a framework for systematic file management, standardize directory structures, implement consistent naming conventions using kebab-case, and create templates and workflows that integrate with your existing file organisation while being optimized for AI automation.

### Why Claude Project Management Matters for FOMO

When working on a comprehensive file organization project like FOMO, conversations with Claude can quickly become disjointed as context gets lost between sessions. Effective project management addresses these challenges by:

- Creating clear structure that helps maintain focus on specific aspects of your file management system
- Preserving context across multiple sessions as you develop different components
- Tracking progress towards your standardization goals
- Ensuring consistency in approach and outcomes across your entire system

### How to Use This Guide

This document provides a practical framework that you can adapt to your FOMO project. Start with the foundation elements to establish basic structure, then adopt implementation tools and integration strategies as you progress through different phases of your file management system development. The examples throughout focus on file naming conventions and directory structures to illustrate practical applications.

## Foundation Elements

### Project Organisation

Even for personal projects like FOMO, effective organisation creates clarity and facilitates progress tracking. A thoughtful structure helps you maintain focus and easily navigate between different aspects of your work.

**Key Organisational Elements:**

* **Project Container**: Group all related work under "FOMO" (File Organisation & Management Organisation)
* **Main Conversation**: Establish core goals, principles, and parameters for your file management system
* **Supporting Conversations**: Focus on specific aspects of your project (naming conventions, directory structures, automation)
* **Reference Conversations**: Store important context and requirements (current system analysis, tool references)

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Create consistent naming patterns**
   * Project: `fomo`
   * Conversations: [Purpose]-[Specific Aspect]
     Example: `research-naming-conventions`
   * Artifacts: [Type]-[Content Description]-v[XX]
     Example: `doc-naming-standards-v01`

2. **Establish essential documentation**
   * Project Charter outlining goals, scope, and principles
   * Context Document capturing background information on current file system
   * Progress Tracker monitoring implementation status

**Example: FOMO Project Structure**

```
PROJECT: FOMO (File Organisation & Management Organisation)

MAIN CONVERSATION: "Core System Standards"
- Initial discussion establishing principles: clarity, consistency, simplicity
- Regular check-ins on implementation progress
- Refinement of standards as needed

SUPPORTING CONVERSATIONS:
- "Implementation - Directory Structure"
- "Research - Naming Conventions"
- "Implementation - Automation Tools"

REFERENCE CONVERSATIONS:
- "Current System Analysis"
- "Tool References"

CORE ARTIFACTS:
- "Doc - Project Charter - v01"
- "Doc - Naming Standards - v01"
- "Doc - Directory Structure - v01"
- "Code - Renaming Script - v01"
```

**Why This Matters**: File management projects often involve many different components and decisions. Clear organisation prevents you from losing track of specific standards or conventions and helps maintain a cohesive approach across your entire system.

### Context Maintenance

Claude's conversation memory has limitations, making deliberate context management essential for a project like FOMO that spans multiple sessions and covers many different aspects of file management.

**Key Context Management Approaches:**

* **Context Documents**: Dedicated artifacts capturing essential system parameters
* **Conversation Bridges**: References connecting different discussions about related file management topics
* **Progressive Summarisation**: Regular condensation of information about your evolving standards

**Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Create specialized context artifacts**
   * FOMO Standards Document capturing core principles and file naming rules
   * Decision Log recording key choices and rationales
   * Examples Library documenting standard patterns for different file types

2. **Build explicit session connections**
   * Begin new sessions with brief summaries of previous decisions
   * Reference specific artifacts that establish necessary context
   * Create clear transition points when moving between different aspects of your file system

**Example: Context Bridge Statement**

```
"I'd like to continue working on the automation scripts for enforcing our kebab-case naming conventions.
As discussed in our 'Core System Standards' conversation, we're focusing on hyphen separators for
directories and files as documented in 'Doc - Naming Standards - v01'. Now let's develop a
Python script to check for compliance across our file system."
```

**Why This Matters**: Context maintenance ensures your FOMO project remains coherent across multiple sessions. It prevents contradictory approaches and reduces the need to repeatedly explain your goals and preferences as you work on different aspects of your file management system.

## Implementation Tools

### Artifact Usage

Artifacts serve as persistent, structured containers for your FOMO project content. They provide superior formatting and organisation compared to conversation text, making them ideal for documenting naming conventions and directory structures.

**Artifact Selection Rationale:**

* Choose **Markdown Documents** (`text/markdown`) for guidelines, principles, and documentation
* Use **Code Artifacts** (`application/vnd.ant.code`) for implementation scripts and automation
* Create **SVG Graphics** (`image/svg+xml`) for visual directory hierarchies
* Develop **Mermaid Diagrams** (`application/vnd.ant.mermaid`) for decision trees and workflows

**Artifact Lifecycle:**

For FOMO project, a practical evolution typically includes:
1. **Creation**: Develop initial version with clear purpose
2. **Review**: Evaluate and refine content
3. **Implementation**: Apply principles to your actual file system
4. **Refinement**: Update based on implementation experience

**Example: FOMO Artifact Strategy**

```
Core Document Artifacts:
- "Doc - Naming Standards - v01" (foundational guidelines using kebab-case)
- "Doc - Directory Structure - v01" (hierarchical organization principles)

Supporting Artifacts:
- "Code - Python Renaming Script - v01"
- "Mermaid - Naming Decision Flowchart - v01"

Example Evolution (Naming Standards):
v01: Initial core principles and basic kebab-case formats
v02: Addition of directory structure recommendations
v03: Expanded with implementation automation guidance
```

**Why This Matters**: Artifacts become the authoritative reference for your FOMO project details. They allow for efficient updates and refinements, ensuring consistency as your file management system evolves.

### Analytics Tool Integration

For FOMO, Claude's Analytics Tool (REPL) can validate approaches and test implementations. This is particularly useful when developing scripts to automate file renaming and reorganization.

**Relevant Analytics Workflows:**

* **Script Testing**: Validate automation scripts before implementation
* **Pattern Analysis**: Test naming patterns against example datasets
* **Implementation Checking**: Scan directories to assess compliance with your standards

**Example: Naming Compliance Script Testing**

```
1. Script Development:
   - Write Python script to check file naming compliance with kebab-case standards
   - Test with sample directory structure in Analytics Tool

2. Pattern Validation:
   - Test kebab-case pattern regular expressions
   - Verify edge cases are handled properly

3. Implementation:
   - Refine script based on testing
   - Create final code artifact for deployment
```

**Why This Matters**: Testing automation approaches before implementation saves time and prevents errors. The Analytics Tool provides validation for scripts that will enforce your kebab-case naming conventions and directory organization.

## Integration Strategies

### Workflow Integration

For FOMO, effective workflows integrate conversations and artifacts into a cohesive process that maintains momentum as you develop and implement your file management system.

**Streamlined FOMO Workflow Patterns:**

* **Research Pattern**: Explore file naming options, document findings, determine kebab-case approach
* **Development Pattern**: Create initial standards, test feasibility, refine
* **Implementation Pattern**: Deploy solution, monitor results, adjust as needed

**Creating Smooth Transitions:**

For FOMO implementation, smooth transitions include:
* Summarise key findings before creating documentation
* Extract rules and patterns before creating implementation tools
* Document outcomes and lessons after testing on directories

**Example: FOMO Implementation Workflow**

```
Research Phase:
1. Conversation exploring naming best practices
2. Creation of principles document artifact
3. Research into automation approaches
4. Documentation of chosen kebab-case approach

Development Phase:
1. Conversation to establish script requirements
2. Creation of script artifact
3. Testing script with sample directories
4. Refinement based on test results

Implementation Phase:
1. Conversation planning rollout strategy
2. Application to test directories
3. Documentation of results and edge cases
4. Refinement of guidelines based on implementation experience
```

**Why This Matters**: Integrated workflows prevent fragmentation and maintain momentum in your FOMO project. They create a natural progression from research to implementation across your entire file system.

### Iterative Development

FOMO benefits significantly from iterative approaches, embracing progressive refinement through repeated cycles of creation, evaluation, and improvement.

**FOMO Iteration Framework:**

For file management, useful iterations include:
* **Principle Development**: Refine core naming principles using kebab-case
* **Format Expansion**: Add formats for new file types or contexts
* **Implementation Enhancement**: Improve automation and validation tools

**Managing FOMO Iterations:**

1. Set clear goals for each iteration cycle
2. Test changes on a subset of directories before full implementation
3. Document learnings and rationales for refinements
4. Maintain version history with meaningful increments

**Example: FOMO Iteration**

```
Initial Framework Iteration:
1. Establish basic principles (clarity, consistency, kebab-case)
2. Define formats for common file types
3. Test with sample directories
4. Document initial version (v01)

Format Expansion Iteration:
1. Add specialized formats for media files
2. Add guidelines for configuration files
3. Test new patterns with relevant examples
4. Update documentation (v02)

Automation Iteration:
1. Develop compliance checking script
2. Create renaming utility
3. Add Git hooks or folder actions for enforcement
4. Update implementation guide (v03)
```

**Why This Matters**: Iteration creates space for evolution and improvement. It acknowledges that effective file management systems develop through practical application and refinement.
