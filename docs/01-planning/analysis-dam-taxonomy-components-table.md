# Digital Asset Management (DAM) Taxonomy Components Table

| Component | Description | Approaches/Types | Best Practices |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Taxonomy Structure** | The fundamental organisation framework for digital assets | **Flat File Taxonomy:** <br>- Assets can exist in multiple locations<br>- Based on metadata rules<br>- Creates visual plane for asset preview<br>- Enables faster searching<br><br>**Hierarchical Taxonomy:** <br>- Traditional folder/subfolder structure<br>- Parent/child relationships<br>- Terms have broader/narrower relationships<br>- "Tree" structure | - Choose structure based on organisational needs<br>- Consider both content types and user experience<br>- Prioritise findability over rigid organisation<br>- Enable assets to be found through multiple pathways |
| **Classification Methodologies** | Methods for categorising and organising digital assets | **Brand-Based:** Top-level organisation by brand identity<br><br>**Collection-Based:** By product line, service, content type, campaign, season<br><br>**User-Based:** By teams, departments, partners, retailers<br><br>**Asset Type-Based:** By file type (images, videos, PDFs, etc.)<br><br>**Metadata-Based:** Using custom fields and controlled vocabulary<br><br>**Label-Based:** Sub-classification using granular tags | - Organise around end-user needs<br>- Interview users about search habits<br>- Design for intuitive self-service<br>- Enable discovery without knowing exact file locations<br>- Maintain consistent classification across organisation |
| **Metadata Framework** | Data that describes and provides details about assets | **Descriptive Metadata:** Content description, keywords, subjects<br><br>**Administrative Metadata:** Creation date, rights, permissions<br><br>**Structural Metadata:** Relationships between assets<br><br>**Technical Metadata:** File format, size, dimensions | - Plan metadata fields strategically<br>- Create custom fields for different content types<br>- Maintain consistency across the organisation<br>- Consider automation for metadata tagging<br>- Design metadata to support search functionality |
| **Controlled Vocabulary** | Standardised terms used for tagging and categorisation | **Authority Files:** Standardised naming conventions<br><br>**Taxonomies:** Hierarchical classification systems<br><br>**Thesauri:** Terms with relationships and synonyms<br><br>**Ontologies:** Complex relationship networks | - Develop finite set of carefully chosen terms<br>- Create clear definitions for each term<br>- Establish relationships between terms<br>- Regularly review and update vocabulary<br>- Balance comprehensiveness with usability |
| **Implementation Process** | Steps for developing and deploying DAM taxonomy | **Audit Phase:** Review existing assets and structure<br><br>**Design Phase:** Map taxonomy structure and metadata<br><br>**Development Phase:** Create controlled vocabulary<br><br>**Testing Phase:** Validate with users<br><br>**Deployment Phase:** Implement in DAM system<br><br>**Maintenance Phase:** Ongoing optimisation | - Audit existing assets before implementation<br>- Identify and consolidate duplicate assets<br>- Establish naming conventions<br>- Test structure with actual users<br>- Continuously refine as library evolves<br>- Adapt to changing organisational needs |
| **Search & Discovery** | Methods for finding and accessing assets | **Keyword Search:** Using specific terms<br><br>**Filtered Search:** Using metadata fields<br><br>**Browse Navigation:** Visual exploration<br><br>**Faceted Search:** Multiple filter combinations | - Design taxonomy around search behavior<br>- Enable search by descriptive terms<br>- Create intuitive filters based on metadata<br>- Allow for discovery of related content<br>- Support both precise search and browsing |
| **Governance & Maintenance** | Ongoing management of taxonomy system | **Centralised Governance:** Single authority<br><br>**Distributed Governance:** Multiple stakeholders<br><br>**Hybrid Governance:** Combined approach | - Designate taxonomy ownership<br>- Establish update procedures<br>- Document taxonomy structure<br>- Train users on taxonomy usage<br>- Regularly review and optimise<br>- Collect usage metrics to inform improvements |
