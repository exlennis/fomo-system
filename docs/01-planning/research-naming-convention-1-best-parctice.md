# File Naming Conventions:  1. Best Practices

Establishing effective file naming conventions on macOS and iOS enhances file organisation, retrieval, and compatibility across systems. Here are research-based best practices:

```java
1. Use Descriptive and Consistent Names

Be Descriptive: Include key details such as project name, date, and version number to identify the file's content and purpose. Maintain Consistency: Adopt a uniform naming structure across all files to prevent confusion.

2. Avoid Special Characters

Restricted Characters: Refrain from using characters like colon (:), forward slash (/), and backslash () in file names, as they may cause issues in certain applications or when sharing files across different platforms. Other Special Characters: Characters such as question marks (?), asterisks (*), and quotation marks (") should also be avoided to ensure compatibility.

3. Utilise Appropriate File Extensions

Include Extensions: Always append the correct file extension (e.g., .docx, .xlsx, .txt) to indicate the file type, aiding both the operating system and users in identifying the appropriate application to open the file. 

4. Implement Logical Organisational Structures

Directory Hierarchy: Organise files into folders and subfolders based on criteria like project, date, or file type to streamline navigation and retrieval.

5. Consider Compatibility with Other Systems

Cross-Platform Sharing: If files will be shared with Windows or other operating systems, ensure that file names are compatible by avoiding special characters and adhering to common naming conventions. 

6. Limit File Name Length

Keep It Manageable: While macOS supports file names up to 255 characters, it's advisable to keep names concise to prevent potential issues with certain applications or when transferring files. 

7. Avoid Leading and Trailing Spaces

Trim Spaces: Do not start or end file names with spaces, as this can lead to errors or misinterpretation by the operating system or software applications.

8. Use Hyphens or Underscores Instead of Spaces

Enhance Readability: Replace spaces with hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to improve readability and prevent issues in environments where spaces are not handled well.

# File Naming Conventions: 2.  Standards & Approaches

---

# I. Standard Approach

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step breakdown of a universal naming standard that **does NOT** use a date‐first approach. This structure is designed to integrate with your directory hierarchy and support version control practices.

---

## 1. Naming Structure Overview

**Naming Format:**

```
Project_Category_Description_Version[_YYYYMMDD].ext

```

*Note:* The optional date is placed at the end. This ensures that files are primarily grouped by project, aligning with your directory structure, while still offering a historical reference when needed.

---

## 2. Component Breakdown

The table below explains each component of the naming standard:

| **Component** | **Purpose** | **Example** | **Integration & Considerations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Project** | Identifies the associated project or client; aligns with the top-level directory. | `ClientA` or `MarketingCampaign` | Use a project name that mirrors your project folder (e.g. `/Projects/MarketingCampaign`). This grouping simplifies navigation and file retrieval. |
| **Category** | Denotes the file type or usage (e.g. document, image, code file). | `Doc`, `Img`, `Code` | Standardised codes ensure consistency. The category supports automated sorting and manual classification within your project directories. |
| **Description** | Provides a concise summary of the file’s content. | `ProjectProposal`, `LandingPage` | Keep the description brief (1–3 words) to enhance clarity. Use underscores to separate multiple words, which supports searchability and readability. |
| **Version** | Tracks file revisions for version control. | `v1`, `v2.1` | Increment the version number with each significant update. This component is critical for iterative design and development, and it works well alongside systems like Git. |
| **Optional Date** | Offers additional context regarding the creation or update date, placed after the version. | `20250206` | Including the date as an optional suffix provides historical context without disrupting the primary sorting by project. It should use the YYYYMMDD format. |
| **Extension** | Denotes the file format. | `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.js` | The extension must match the file type; it is automatically recognised by the operating system and applications. |

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Example

Consider a code file within a marketing campaign project. The steps below illustrate how to build the file name:

1. **Project:**
    - Begin with the project name that matches the corresponding directory.
    - *Example:* `MarketingCampaign`
2. **Category:**
    - Add the code file category.
    - *Example:* `Code`
3. **Description:**
    - Provide a brief description of the file’s function.
    - *Example:* `LandingPage`
4. **Version:**
    - Append the version number to indicate the file iteration.
    - *Example:* `v2`
5. **Optional Date:**
    - Optionally add the date (YYYYMMDD) after the version for historical context.
    - *Example:* `20250206`
    - *If omitted, the file name will not include a date.*
6. **Extension:**
    - Conclude with the file extension.
    - *Example:* `.js`

**Resulting File Name (with date):**

```
MarketingCampaign_Code_LandingPage_v2_20250206.js

```

**Resulting File Name (without date):**

```
MarketingCampaign_Code_LandingPage_v2.js

```

---

## 4. Integration with Directory Hierarchy & Version Control

The following table explains how this naming standard supports your overall file management system:

| **Aspect** | **Integration Details** | **Key Benefits** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Directory Hierarchy** | The first element (Project) aligns directly with your top-level folders. For example, files stored in `/Projects/MarketingCampaign` begin with `MarketingCampaign`. | Simplifies navigation and maintains consistency across file systems. |
| **File Type Sorting** | The Category field (e.g. `Doc`, `Img`, `Code`) enables quick classification and automated sorting within each project folder. | Enhances searchability and supports tools like Hazel for automated sorting. |
| **Version Control** | The Version component (e.g. `v1`, `v2.1`) clearly identifies iterations of a file, aiding in tracking changes and coordinating updates within teams. | Facilitates easier tracking of revisions and is compatible with Git or similar systems. |
| **Optional Date** | Placing the date at the end provides additional context without affecting primary sorting by project or category. | Offers historical reference without disrupting the main hierarchy sorting. |

---

## 5. Final Considerations

- **Consistency:** Ensure that all team members use the same naming standard to maintain uniformity across projects.
- **Automation:** With a clear structure, automated tools can reliably parse each element for sorting, archiving, or version control purposes.
- **Documentation:** Create a style guide that details this naming convention. This document should be shared within your team for ongoing reference and training.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive naming standard that avoids a date-first approach while integrating seamlessly with your directory hierarchy and version control practices. If you require further details on automating these conventions or additional file type codes, please let me know.

# II. Date-First Approach

Below is a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of the universal naming standard and how it integrates with your directory hierarchy. Each section is presented in a table format to ensure clarity.

---

### 1. Overall Naming Structure

| **Component** | **Purpose & Details** | **Example** | **Considerations** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date | Provides chronological context; using ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD) for uniformity and sorting. | `20250206` | Use for all files; optionally add time (e.g., `20250206_1530`) for time-sensitive files. |
| Project | Indicates the associated project or client; helps group files by context. | `ClientA` or `Internal` | Choose a clear project name; align with your directory project folders. |
| Category | Denotes the file type or usage; differentiates between documents, images, code files, etc. | `Doc`, `Img`, `Code` | Standardise codes across your team; consult the table below for common file type codes. |
| Description | Summarises file content succinctly; adds context beyond the file type and project. | `ProjectProposal` | Keep it brief (typically 1-3 words); avoid spaces and special characters (use underscores). |
| Version | Marks the file revision or iteration; supports version control within filenames. | `v1` or `v2.1` | Update consistently as files evolve; consider additional identifiers (e.g., beta, final) if needed. |
| Extension | The standard file format extension; identifies the file type to the operating system and applications. | `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.js` | Do not modify manually; ensure file conversion or export tools use the correct extension. |

**Overall Naming Example:**

`20250206_ClientA_Doc_ProjectProposal_v1.pdf`

---

### 2. File Type Codes and Conventions

This table lists common file types and suggested codes to maintain consistency:

Implementing effective file naming and versioning conventions is crucial for maintaining organization and ensuring efficient retrieval, especially in design projects with multiple stages and revisions.

Date-First Naming Approach:

Using a date-first format (e.g., YYYYMMDD_filename.ext) is beneficial for files that need to be sorted chronologically. This structure ensures that files are ordered by date, facilitating easy access to the most recent or specific versions. It's particularly useful for:

Daily Logs or Reports: Ensures sequential order of entries.
Meeting Minutes: Allows quick reference to specific meeting dates.
Financial Records: Organizes statements or transactions by date.
Project Progress Photos: Chronologically orders visual documentation.
By placing the date at the beginning, files naturally sort in chronological order, enhancing retrieval efficiency. 
HURIDOCS.ORG

Versioning in Design Projects:

In design projects, clear versioning is essential due to multiple stages and revisions. A consistent versioning system helps track progress and collaborate effectively. Consider the following approach:

Major Versions: Indicate significant milestones or changes (e.g., v1, v2).
Minor Revisions: Denote minor updates or tweaks (e.g., v1.1, v1.2).
Descriptors: Use clear labels like draft, final, or revA to convey the file's status.
Recommended Naming Convention:

Combine elements to create a comprehensive file name:

[ProjectName]_[AssetDescription]_[YYYYMMDD]_v[Major].[Minor]_[Status].[Extension]
Example:

BrandCampaign_LogoDesign_20250206_v2.1_final.ai
Explanation:

ProjectName: Identifies the project (e.g., BrandCampaign).
AssetDescription: Describes the asset (e.g., LogoDesign).
YYYYMMDD: Indicates the date (e.g., 20250206).
v2.1: Specifies major version 2, minor revision 1.
final: Denotes the status of the file.
.ai: File extension indicating the format.
This structured approach ensures clarity, facilitates version tracking, and enhances collaboration within design teams.

# **Automated File Renaming Using AI and Content Recognition**

Automating file renaming with **AI-powered content recognition** allows files to be named dynamically based on their **actual contents**, rather than just metadata or predefined rules. This enhances **searchability, organisation, and automation efficiency**. Below is a **deep dive** into the available methods, best practices, and advanced AI capabilities.

---

## **1. Types of Content Recognition for Automated Renaming**

### **A. Text Extraction (OCR for PDFs, Scans, and Images)**

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) allows files to be renamed based on detected text content.

- **Use Cases**:
    - Extract invoice numbers from **PDF receipts** to rename files (`Invoice_20240206.pdf`).
    - Identify the **title of a scanned document** and use it for renaming.
    - Recognise handwritten or printed text in images (e.g., **scanned notes, book covers**).
- **Tools**:
    - **Apple Vision Framework** *(macOS/iOS native OCR – used by Hazel, Shortcuts)*
    - **Tesseract OCR** *(Open-source, supports multiple languages and handwriting)*
    - **Google Cloud Vision OCR** *(AI-powered cloud-based OCR)*
    - **Adobe Acrobat Pro** *(Built-in OCR with metadata extraction)*

### **B. Metadata Extraction (EXIF for Images, Video Metadata, PDF Properties)**

- **Use Cases**:
    - Rename **photos** using **date, GPS location, and camera model**.
        - `IMG_20240206_Melbourne_Daytime.jpg`
    - Rename **videos** based on resolution, duration, and encoding type.
        - `Video_4K_HDR_120fps.mp4`
    - Extract **PDF properties** (title, author, keywords) and use them for naming.
        - `ResearchPaper_Author_2024.pdf`
- **Tools**:
    - **ExifTool** *(Extracts metadata from images, PDFs, audio, and video files)*
    - **Hazel** *(Reads metadata from files and renames them accordingly)*
    - **Apple Shortcuts** *(Can extract image/video metadata using built-in actions)*
    - **FFmpeg** *(Can extract video/audio metadata and rename files based on it)*

### **C. AI-Based Content Analysis (LLM, NLP, and Machine Learning)**

AI models can go beyond simple metadata and extract **contextual meaning** from files.

- **Use Cases**:
    - **Summarise document content** and rename files based on their key topics.
        - `MeetingNotes_AppleVisionStrategy.pdf`
    - Use **speech-to-text AI** to rename **audio recordings and podcasts**.
        - `Interview_TimCook_2024.m4a`
    - Categorise **news articles, blog posts, or research papers** based on AI-driven topic analysis.
        - `AIRegulation_WhitePaper_2024.pdf`
- **Tools**:
    - **ChatGPT/OpenAI API** *(Summarises documents, extracts key phrases)*
    - **Whisper AI (OpenAI)** *(Speech-to-text model for transcribing audio)*
    - **Claude AI (Anthropic)** *(Understanding context and summarising content)*
    - **Google Vision AI** *(Classifies images, reads text, and extracts features)*

### **D. Barcode, QR Code, and Data Recognition**

- **Use Cases**:
    - Rename **invoices or shipping labels** using barcode data.
    - Extract **product details** from QR codes for consistent naming.
    - Automate renaming of scanned documents based on **barcode identifiers**.
- **Tools**:
    - **ZBar (CLI tool for barcode recognition)**
    - **Google Cloud Vision API (QR/Barcode detection)**
    - **Apple’s VisionKit (Native barcode scanning on iOS/macOS)**

## **2. Automation Workflows for File Renaming**

### **Workflow 1: Hazel + Apple Shortcuts**

💡 **Best for:** Local automation, OCR-based PDF renaming, image EXIF metadata-based renaming.

1. **Hazel watches a folder (e.g., ~/Downloads/)**
2. **Apple Shortcuts extracts text from PDFs/images using OCR.**
3. **Hazel renames the file based on extracted text.**
4. **Moves renamed file to an appropriate folder.**

### **Workflow 2: Hazel + ExifTool for Image Metadata**

💡 **Best for:** Photos, videos, and scanned images using EXIF metadata.

1. **Hazel detects a new image file.**
2. **ExifTool extracts GPS location, timestamp, and camera model.**
3. **Hazel renames the file (`2024-02-06_Melbourne_Sunset.jpg`).**
4. **Moves it to a structured folder (`Photos/2024/February`).**

### **Workflow 3: AI-Powered Renaming with ChatGPT + Hazel**

💡 **Best for:** AI-based naming using document content, LLM processing, and NLP.

1. **Hazel detects a new document (PDF, text file, or report).**
2. **Apple Shortcuts extracts text and sends it to an OpenAI GPT model.**
3. **GPT suggests a meaningful filename based on the document’s content.**
4. **Hazel renames the file and moves it to the correct folder.**

### **Workflow 4: Whisper AI for Audio Transcription-Based Renaming**

💡 **Best for:** Naming voice memos, interviews, and podcasts.

1. **New audio file added to `~/Recordings/`.**
2. **Whisper AI transcribes the first 10 seconds.**
3. **Hazel renames file based on detected keywords.**
    - `2024_Interview_AppleVision.m4a`
4. **File is sorted into `~/Audio/Interviews/`.**

## **3. AI-Powered File Naming Best Practices**

To maintain **consistency and accuracy**, apply best practices for AI-driven file renaming:

1. **Keep filenames concise but descriptive.**
    - ❌ `Document_482038320832.pdf`
    - ✅ `2024_Tax_Return_AUS.pdf`
2. **Standardise date formatting.**
    - ✅ Use `YYYYMMDD` to maintain chronological order (`20240206_Invoice.pdf`).
3. **Avoid special characters** that may break compatibility.
    - ❌ `Meeting: Notes?!.pdf`
    - ✅ `Meeting_Notes_2024.pdf`
4. **For OCR-based naming, always verify text accuracy manually first.**
    - AI-driven renaming should be **reviewed manually** before full automation.
5. **Use AI confidence scoring for automation decisions.**
    - If OCR accuracy < 90%, **prompt for manual review** instead of renaming.
