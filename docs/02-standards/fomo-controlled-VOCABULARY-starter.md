## Implementation Notes

1. This starter set includes approximately 25 core terms that form the foundation of the FOMO system vocabulary.

2. When implementing this vocabulary:
   - Use Level 1 terms exactly as shown for top-level directories
   - Combine Level 2+ terms as needed using hyphens for compound concepts (e.g., `client-project`)
   - Apply status/workflow terms as suffixes with hyphens (e.g., `website-draft`)
   - Apply temporal terms as prefixes with hyphens (e.g., `legacy-configs`)

3. For tagging applications:
   - Use the same terms without capitalization
   - Apply as individual tags rather than compound terms where possible
   - Example: For a client project draft, use tags `#client` + `#project` + `#draft` rather than `#client-project-draft`

4. This starter set will be expanded during implementation, focusing first on your primary work domains (design and development).
