## Conversation Summary: 2025-03-26

> FOMO Taxonomy Discussion & Controlled Vocabulary Planning

### Context

- Query: Analyse and compare the "fomo-tag-management-guidelines" against key documents in the project knowledge section, focusing on "naming-STANDARDS-v02" and "directory-structure-GUIDELINES-v02", while also considering three research analysis reports. Provide a comprehensive analysis and rate the tag management guideline.
- Topic: FOMO project document analysis, controlled vocabulary development, tag management guidelines assessment

### Key Points

1. The Tag Management Guidelines (rated 7/10) show strong framework alignment but lack technical implementation details, governance structure, migration strategy, and domain-specific guidance compared to other FOMO documents.
2. A controlled vocabulary is necessary for consistent terminology across the FOMO system to prevent inconsistency, ensure cross-platform consistency, reduce cognitive load, facilitate searching, and support automation.
3. The "flat with controlled vocabulary" tagging approach aligns with research findings, offering greater flexibility than hierarchical structures while maintaining consistency.
4. The controlled vocabulary starter set (25 foundational terms) provides a structured foundation organised by category with Level 1 terms (capitalised for top-level folders) and Level 2+ terms (lowercase kebab-case).
5. The FOMO project primarily manages design and development files across personal/client projects with automation goals including Hazel rules, Shortcuts, scripting, and n8n workflows.

### Conclusions & Questions

- Resolved:
  - A controlled vocabulary is essential and the project is ready to begin developing one
  - Tag Management Guidelines need revision to integrate with the controlled vocabulary
  - Flat taxonomy with controlled vocabulary is the preferred tagging approach
  - The brief and prompt for creating the controlled vocabulary document align with the FOMO framework

- Open:
  - Specific implementation details for tags across different applications
  - Governance structures appropriate for personal tagging systems
  - Migration strategies for existing tagging systems

### Next Steps

- Integrate the controlled vocabulary starter set with the broader FOMO framework
- Implement feedback recommendations for the Tag Management Guidelines
- Develop domain-specific extensions to the controlled vocabulary
- Create technical implementation guidelines for tagging across platforms
- Document workflows specifically for design project lifecycle and design-to-development handoff
