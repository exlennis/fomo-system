- **Topic**: FOMO Controlled Vocabulary, Term Dictionary
- **Session Focus**: Implementing modular structure for controlled vocabulary
- **Participants**: User, Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Context

  - Format: Markdown
  - Contains: Alphabetical term listing with consistent entry format

## Action Items
- Develop Framework Document based on Term Dictionary
- Create Domain Extensions for design and development contexts
- Generate Term Cheatsheet for high-priority terms
- Develop Implementation Guide for practical adoption
- Produce Visual Relationship Maps to show term connections

## Notes for Next Session
