# Warp Drive Audit - Master Index

## Introduction

This Master Index Document serves as the primary navigation and organisational tool for the Warp Drive audit. Its purpose is to provide a overview of all commands, workflows, and documentation exported from the Warp Drive. This document categorises commands by their functional purpose rather than their original directory structure, allowing for easier discovery and use of related commands regardless of where they are stored.

Use this document as your starting point for exploring the Warp Drive audit data. The linked sections provide detailed information about specific command categories and their respective functionalities.

## Command Categories

- [File System Commands](#file-system) - Commands for navigating, searching, and managing files, directories and system maintenance and monitoring
- [Development Commands](#development) -  Commands related to programming environments, Git, and other development tools.
- [Workflow Commands](#workflow) Commands that enhance productivity and automate processes.
- [Notes & References](#notes) - Knowledge bases, guides, best practices, and reference material for CLI usage.
