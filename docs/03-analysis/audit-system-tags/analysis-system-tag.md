# **FOMO Unified Tagging System (Updated-20250202)**

## **Core Issues with the Previous Tagging System**
1. **Too Complex** → Too many tags, categories, and touchpoints across apps.
2. **Hard to Maintain** → Required excessive effort to consistently apply.
3. **Lack of Consistency** → Different apps used different structures, making recall difficult.
4. **Overplanning → Abandonment** → Large systems don’t work long-term if they aren’t gradually adopted.

---

## **New Unified Approach: Simple, Scalable, & Cross-App Compatible**
### **Key Principles**
- **Minimalist & Expandable** → Start with a core set of **5+2 essential tags**.
- **Consistency Across Apps** → Standardise tagging structure across Finder, Notes, Reminders, and Mail.
- **Automated Where Possible** → Leverage **Smart Folders, Hazel, and Shortcuts** to reduce manual effort.
- **Gradual Implementation** → Begin with manual tagging, then automate as the system stabilises.

## **Core Tagging System (5+2 Tags)**
### **Primary Tags (Core 5)**
1. **`#work`** → Projects, clients, work-related files.
2. **`#personal`** → Finance, health, subscriptions, and #dixxxon content.
3. **`#reference`** → Static useful information (guides, templates, documents).
4. **`#todo`** → Tasks, reminders, and follow-ups.
5. **`#archive`** → Completed or old items to be retained but not actively accessed.

### **Secondary Tags (Expandable 2)**
6. **#family** → Managing things for parents/partner.
7. **#dixxxon** → Used as a subcategory under #personal.

**Example Tag Hierarchy:**
```
• #work
   └─ #family
• #personal
   └─ #dixxxon
• #todo
• #reference
• #archive
```

## **Application of the Unified Tagging System**

### **1. Finder: Smart Folders & File Management**
**Steps:**
1. **Create Smart Folders** based on the **6 core tags**.
   - Example: A Smart Folder for `#work` that finds files tagged with `#work`.
2. **Manually Tag Files** (start with recent or frequently accessed files).
   - Right-click a file → Tags → Add the relevant tag (e.g., `#work`).

**Automation Considerations:**
- Start manually → Once comfortable, set up **Hazel rules** to auto-tag based on file type/location.

---

### **2. Apple Notes: Smart Folders & Tagging**
**Steps:**
1. **Create Smart Folders** in Notes for each tag.
   - Example: `#work` → Work-related notes.
   - Example: `#todo` → Action items.
2. **Manually apply tags** to notes (using the Tag button).
3. **Automate tagging** where possible (e.g., Apple Shortcuts for bulk processing).

---

### **3. Reminders: Streamlined Task Organisation**
**Steps:**
1. Create **3 core lists**:
   - **Work** → Work-related tasks.
   - **Personal** → Personal-related tasks.
   - **Follow-Up** → Tasks that require revisiting.
2. **Use tags for context** (e.g., `#work` and `#todo`).

---

### **4. Gradual Cleanup of Existing Tags**
**Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Prioritise Active Files/Notes/Tasks** → Clean up things you use frequently.
2. **Delete/Consolidate Redundant Tags** → Merge overlapping tags (e.g., `#dixon` → `#dixxxon`).
3. **Monthly Tag Review** → Spend 15 minutes monthly reviewing and cleaning up unnecessary tags.
4. **Use a “Review” Folder** → When uncertain, move items into a review folder before archiving or deleting.

---

### **5. Trusting Automation (Step-by-Step Adoption)**
1. **Start with Manual Tagging** → Apply tags manually and set up Smart Folders.
2. **Gradually Introduce Automation** → Use Hazel for Finder and Shortcuts for Notes/Reminders.
3. **Maintain Transparency in Automation** → Hazel can provide preview actions before executing.

*By simplifying and automating tagging, this system ensures that your digital workspace remains efficient and scalable.*
