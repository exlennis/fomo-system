# FOMO Directory Architecture Feasibility Analysis

Based on my analysis of the current directory structure, cloud storage paths, permissions, and disk usage, here's a comprehensive feasibility assessment for implementing your FOMO directory architecture:

## Current State Summary

1. **Local Directory**: 129GB of data in various development-related subdirectories
2. **Cloud Storage**:
   - **Dropbox**: Already organized with FOMO-like categories
     - `-PROJECTS-`: 2.8MB
     - `-DESIGN-`: 37GB
     - `-WORK-`: 12MB with subfolders for Career, Education, Employment, Freelance, Portfolio
   - **iCloud**: Contains Obsidian, Notes, and GoodNotes (likely knowledge management)
   - **Google Drive**: Small footprint (32KB)
   - **iCloud Drive**: 353MB in default location

3. **Disk Space**: 926GB total with 202GB available (78% used)
4. **Permissions**: All examined directories have appropriate permissions

## FOMO Implementation Feasibility

Your current structure already shows alignment with FOMO principles, particularly in Dropbox with distinct categories for Projects, Design, and Work. The knowledge category appears to be primarily in iCloud applications.

### Recommendations

1. **Create FOMO Top-Level Structure**:
   - Create top-level directories for Focus, Output, Misc, and Organization
   - Local and cloud storage directories can be mapped as follows:
     - **Focus**: Link to Obsidian/Notes from iCloud
     - **Output**: Link to -PROJECTS-, -DESIGN- from Dropbox
     - **Misc**: Consider creating a new directory structure
     - **Organization**: Link to -WORK- from Dropbox

2. **Permission and Symlink Strategy**:
   - No permission issues were detected that would prevent restructuring
   - Consider using symlinks to maintain cloud service sync while presenting a unified FOMO structure

3. **Space Considerations**:
   - The current disk has 202GB free which should be sufficient for restructuring
   - Most content can be linked rather than duplicated to avoid space issues

4. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Start with creating the top-level FOMO structure
   - Gradually migrate or link existing content
   - Test sync functionality after each major change
   - Consider a backup before implementing major changes

5. **Potential Challenges**:
   - Cloud service sync conflicts if paths change dramatically
   - Ensuring applications can follow symlinks if used
   - Managing the large Local directory (129GB) and -DESIGN- directory (37GB)

The implementation appears feasible with minimal risk if done methodically and with appropriate backups in place. The existing organization in Dropbox particularly provides a good foundation for the transition to FOMO architecture.

# FOMO Directory Architecture Implementation Plan

Based on the feasibility analysis, I'm pleased to confirm that implementing our directory architecture is highly feasible! The analysis shows your existing structure already has good organizational patterns, particularly in Dropbox, which will make the transition smoother.

## Key Findings from the Analysis

- **Current organization**: Your Dropbox structure already follows similar categories to our plan
- **Sufficient space**: 202GB available is plenty for restructuring operations
- **Permissions**: No permission issues detected that would block implementation
- **Scale considerations**: Local (129GB) and Dropbox -DESIGN- (37GB) confirm our symlink approach is appropriate

## Clarification on Directory Structure

I notice the analysis references "Focus, Output, Misc, and Organization" which differs from our proposed architecture. Let's reaffirm that our FOMO (File Organisation, Management & Optimisation) structure consists of:

- **Resources/** - Centralised asset hub
- **Projects/** - Unified project access
- **Knowledge/** - Consolidated knowledge system
- **System/** - System configuration
- **Work/** - Work-related personal documents

## Implementation Plan Based on Analysis

### Phase 1: Create Top-Level Framework (Day 1)
```bash
# Create the core directory structure
mkdir -p ~/Resources/{assets,templates,libraries,fonts}
mkdir -p ~/Projects/{dev,design}
mkdir -p ~/Knowledge/{vault,docs,reference}
mkdir -p ~/System/{configs,scripts}
mkdir -p ~/Work
```

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Symlinks (Day 2)
Set up symlinks for lower-volume directories first:

```bash
# Knowledge symlinks (Obsidian)
ln -sf "$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Notes" ~/Knowledge/vault

# Projects symlinks
ln -sf "$HOME/Local/-PROJECTS-Dev" ~/Projects/dev
ln -sf "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/-PROJECTS-" ~/Projects/design

# Work symlinks
ln -sf "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/-WORK-" ~/Work
```

### Phase 3: Higher-Volume Symlinks (Day 3-4)
Handle the larger directories with care:

```bash
# Resources symlinks (larger directories)
ln -sf "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/-DESIGN-/Assets" ~/Resources/assets
ln -sf "$HOME/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-Personal/-DESIGN-/Resources" ~/Knowledge/reference
```

### Phase 4: Configuration and Testing (Day 5-6)
```bash
# Copy relevant configuration files to System
cp ~/.zshrc ~/System/configs/
# Add shell aliases for the new structure
echo 'alias res="cd ~/Resources"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias proj="cd ~/Projects"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias know="cd ~/Knowledge"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias sys="cd ~/System"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Risk Mitigation

Based on the analysis, these specific precautions are recommended:

1. **Backup First**: Create a Time Machine backup or equivalent before starting
2. **Cloud Sync Verification**: Ensure Dropbox and iCloud are fully synced before creating symlinks
3. **Start Small**: Test with a few smaller directories before linking the larger ones (37GB -DESIGN-)
4. **Test Cloud Sync**: After creating each symlink, verify cloud sync continues to work properly
5. **Create a Rollback Plan**: Document the original state so you can revert if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Create Backup**: Run a full system backup
2. **Verify Cloud Sync**: Check that all cloud services are fully synced
3. **Implement Phase 1**: Create the top-level directories
4. **Test Sync**: Confirm no sync issues with empty directories
5. **Proceed Incrementally**: Move through phases 2-4 with testing between each

The feasibility analysis confirms we're on the right track, and your existing organization will make this transition quite smooth. Would you like to proceed with this implementation plan, or would you prefer to adjust any aspects before beginning?
