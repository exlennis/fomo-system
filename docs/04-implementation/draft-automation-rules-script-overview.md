List of Automation to set up
Would you like an automation shortcut to help tag new notes faster?
Would you like an automation shortcut to quickly tag notes while you transition?
Would you like a Shortcut automation to quickly apply tags when moving notes?
Would you like an automation shortcut to check for inconsistent tag casing and suggest fixes?
automation for Retrieve all notes and extract tags.
automation for Check for variations (e.g., #Work, #work, #WORK).
automation for Suggest a unified format (e.g., #work).
automation for Provide a list of notes needing updates so you can manually confirm before applying changes.


  


üìåüìåüìåüìå
- file extension consistency, change old standards to new ones, e.g. .markdown to .md, .jpeg vs .jpg???
- an automation shortcut to check for inconsistent in tag casing and suggest fixes e.g. work vs working vs Work
- an automation shortcut to check for inconsistent in file naming and suggest fixes . e.g. _ vs -
- Auoamte app update workflow > Latest installation then check macudpater and app store ? brew instlls?
- auto cover files: with a dropzone setup-
- .doc or .docs to .md


  


WORKFLOWS

AI-powered content analysis to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Scan note content and extract key topics, themes, and keywords.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Recommend connections between notes based on shared concepts.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify redundant or overlapping notes for better organisation.





```
Yes! You can **automatically convert** `.doc` or `.docx` files to `.md` (Markdown) using **Pandoc**, Python, or Google Apps Script. Below are three methods to automate this process.

---

## **Method 1: Pandoc (Best for Batch Conversion)**
**Pandoc** is the most powerful tool for document conversion.

### **Setup Pandoc**
1. **Install Pandoc**:
   - **macOS (Homebrew)**:
     ```sh
     brew install pandoc
     ```
   - **Windows (Chocolatey)**:
     ```sh
     choco install pandoc
     ```
   - **Linux**:
     ```sh
     sudo apt install pandoc
     ```

2. **Convert a Single File**
   ```sh
   pandoc input.docx -t markdown -o output.md
   ```

3. **Batch Convert All `.docx` in a Folder**
   ```sh
   for file in *.docx; do pandoc "$file" -t markdown -o "${file%.docx}.md"; done
   ```

4. **Automate with a Scheduled Script**
   Create a cron job (Linux/macOS) or a scheduled task (Windows) to run the script automatically.

---

## **Method 2: Python + Pandoc (For More Control)**
Use **Python with Pandoc** to automate batch conversion.

### **Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install pypandoc
```

### **Python Script**
```python
import os
import pypandoc

input_folder = "path/to/docx/files"
output_folder = "path/to/md/output"

for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
    if filename.endswith(".docx") or filename.endswith(".doc"):
        input_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)
        output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename.rsplit(".", 1)[0] + ".md")

        pypandoc.convert_file(input_path, 'md', outputfile=output_path)
        print(f"Converted: {filename} ‚Üí {output_path}")
```

### **Automate the Script**
- **macOS/Linux**: Add to `crontab -e`
  ```sh
  0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py
  ```
- **Windows**: Use Task Scheduler.

## Implementation Status

The FOMO system project is currently in its planning phase. While detailed documentation exists outlining planned automation components, implementation scripts have not yet been developed. The scripts directory exists but does not currently contain complete automation implementation files.

## Learning Objectives

Through implementing these automation components, the project aims to:

- Build expertise in Hazel rule creation
- Develop Apple Shortcuts proficiency
- Enhance Python scripting capabilities
- Explore n8n workflow potential
- Integrate with version control systems through git hooks
