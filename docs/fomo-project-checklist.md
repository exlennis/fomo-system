# FOMO Project Starter & Status

The File Organisation, Management & Optimisation (FOMO) system is a structured framework designed to establish:
- Clear naming conventions and directory structures
- Balanced human readability with machine processing requirements
- Consistent application and automation across personal and professional contexts

## Getting Started

The Getting Started section provides an entry point for understanding the FOMO system framework. For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the specific documentation referenced below.

1. Review the `Project Charter` for scope and guiding principles
3. Reference the `Project Status/Checklist` for current progress and next steps
4. Consult `Project Structure` for understanding the project organisation
4. Examine `Standards & Guidelines` documents for specific implementation guidelines

### Key Documents
1. Project Documents:
    - Project Charter (`fomo-project-charter.md`) - Strategic overview and vision
    - Project Setup Plan (`fomo-project-setup-plan.md`) - detailed setup plans and implementation guide
    - Project Structure (`fomo-project-structure-20250328.md`) - Project Directory map and organisation

2. Standards & Guidelines:
    - Naming Standards (`fomo-naming-STANDARDS-v##.md`) - Filename formatting rules
    - Directory Structure Guidelines (`fomo-directory-structure-GUIDELINES-v##.md`) - Folder hierarchy
    - Controlled Vocabulary (`fomo-controlled-VOCABULARY-v##.md`) - Taxonomy and Terminology standardisation

3. Progress Tracking:
    - Maintenance Log (`fomo-project-maintenance-log.md`) - Implementation history and change log
    - This Document: Project Starter & Status (`fomo-project-starter-and-status.md`) - Quick starter guide, checklist, task tracking and progress

### Offsite Locations

The FOMO system maintains two essential off-site locations. These act as centralised resources, providing system-wide and cross-project functionality. When onboarding, please review these two key locations.

1. **Documentation Repository** (`~/Knowledge/docs/`)
    - Contains standardised guidelines and reference documents
    - Houses language and domain-specific standards
    - Serves as a centralised knowledge base for the project
    - Requires regular updates to maintain accuracy

2. **Scripts Library** (`~/System/scripts/`)  
    - Centralised location for all automation scripts
    - Organised by language/platform (AppleScript, Python, Shell, etc.)
    - Includes complete bundles and standalone utilities
    - Critical for maintaining system automation
