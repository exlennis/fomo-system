**Documentation Repository:** (`~/Knowledge/docs/`) 

- Maintain standardised guidelines
- Keep reference documents updated
- Apply naming standards consistently to all document 
- Smart truncation that preserves word boundaries completeness

**Scripts Library:** (`~/System/scripts/`) 

- Centralise all automation scripts
- Maintain script directory structure by language/type
- Document all scripts with consistent headers and usage notes
- Perform monthly testing of critical automation scripts

## 5. Next Steps

Based on review of the FOMO project documents (checklist, structure, maintenance log, charter, and other supporting documents), Here is an assessment of the project progress and recommendations for next steps.

### 5.1 Documentation Consolidation

I noticed there's been significant progress that may not be fully reflected across all documents. I recommend:

- Update the Project Charter's success metrics with latest measurements
- Ensure cross-references between documents point to the correct versions
- Consolidate the automation documentation into a comprehensive overview

### 5.2 Implementation Focus

Based on the checklist, these areas would benefit from focused attention:

- Complete the Apple Shortcuts for screenshots and common file types
- Implement tag management guidelines in practice
- Develop special cases documentation

### 5.3 Verification and Testing

It's a good time to verify the effectiveness of your system:

- Run compliance tests on recently created files
- Validate directory structure against the standards
- Test automation scripts across different contexts

### 5.4 Documentation of Offsite Resources

Your project structure shows two key offsite locations that would benefit from:

- Clear documentation of the relationship between project and offsite locations
- Guidelines for maintaining consistency between locations
- Verification processes for offsite script testing

## 6. Project Progress Assessment

1. **Integration Strength**: The system shows excellent integration between theoretical standards and practical implementation.
2. **Automation Success**: The development of numerous automation tools (particularly in `~/System/scripts/`) demonstrates significant progress beyond just documentation.
3. **Knowledge Base Growth**: The expansion into areas like prompt management shows how the system is adapting to emerging needs.
4. **Practical Application**: The maintenance log entries show real-world application and problem-solving rather than just theoretical planning.

### 6.1 Open Questions (requires review and resolution)

- [ ] What's the best approach for handling client project archives?
- [ ] How to manage large design asset libraries efficiently?
- [ ] Which automation tool is best suited for batch operations?
- [ ] How to handle legacy files that don't conform to new standards?
- [ ] How to balance domain-specific naming conventions with system-wide standards?
- [ ] How to incorporate design-specific state indicators into naming patterns?
- [ ] How to establish consistent implementation of controlled vocabulary across domains?
- [ ] What's the best approach for screenshot handling and automation?
- [ ] How to maintain synchronisation between main project and offsite locations?
- [ ] What verification process should be established for offsite script testing?

### 6.3 Parking Lot (for furture refinments)

- Metadata tagging system
- Better Utilise Public Folder e.g. for backups and staging
- Integration with cloud storage services
- AI-assisted file categorisation
- Expanded font management system
