# FOMO Project Setup Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The File Organisation, Management & Optimisation project (code named FOMO) aims to create a practical file management system with clear naming conventions and directory structures that can be consistently applied and automated.

> Why the name FOMO? Because there's a "fear of missing out" on one special character that could cause mayhem for both humans and agents.

File naming and directory structure foundations are essential to any modern system, whether personal or enterprise-level.

This plan provides a balanced approach that respects the need for thorough standards while emphasising practical implementation. By focusing on automation from the start and implementing in phases, the system can deliver value immediately while evolving over time.

**Background**

> My plan is to use agents via terminal commands for much of the implementation, initial clean-up, ongoing maintenance and regular checks. This approach requires clear, consistent documentation to ensure the system functions correctly.

As a designer on a development journey, my file system contains a diverse range of document types requiring domain-specific considerations:

- **Design Projects**: Files are phase and revision-based (temporal), yet contain substantial visual reference materials. Final deliverables/branded assets are intended for long-term usage (not time-based). Due to client-facing nature, human readability is crucial.

- **Development Projects**: Research outlines different naming requirements for different languages. These projects are iterative in nature, with compatibility and machine readability being key considerations, often emphasising CI/CD practices.

- **Personal Files**: Screenshots, freelance invoices, personal documents and work files require varying organisation approaches.

- **Special Collections**: An extensive font library, design asset collections, Markdown notes in Obsidian values and reference materials need specific organisation strategies.

An elegant framework should be clear and concise for ease of implementation. It should be structured but not limiting, with consideration for special cases.

**Guiding Principles:**
- Prioritise clarity and consistency over complexity that suit individual usage.
- Strive for a balanced approach between standards and practical applications.
- Incorporate usage patterns and workflow observations into the standards.
- Ensure the solution is both readable by humans and processable by machines.
- Roll out the changes in phases to reduce disruptions during adoption.

## 2. Project Requirements

This project builds upon Claudeâ€™s projects, artefacts, and analytics tools to create a well-organised, maintainable system optimised for both human and agent interaction. In terms of importance, the project requires:

1. **Centralise Documentation**: Create a single reference point for the file management system project through persistent documentation.
2. **Establish Project Structure**: Set up core conversations and essential artefacts. Maintain version tracking as standards evolve.
3. **Implement in Clear Phases**: Adopt a phased approach, beginning with new files and progressively working backwards.
4. **Define Explicit Standards**: Develop standards based on thorough research and testing, including naming conventions, file structures, workflow processes, and automation rules.
5. **Interactive Testing**: Conduct iterative testing of naming patterns and rules to provide immediate feedback on proposed conventions.
6. **Prioritise Automation**: Automate processes wherever possible using tools like Hazel, Shortcuts, Python scripts, and n8n workflows.
7. **Ensure Safe Code Generation**: Prioritise safety in the development of automation scripts and tooling.
8. **Harness Claude's Capabilities**: Use this project as an opportunity to master Claude's project management, documentation, and analytical tools.
9. **Maintain Project Coherence**: Proactively summarise discussions, cross-reference documentation, and maintain structured conversations to keep the project focused and on track.

## 6. Key Technical Decisions

The following decisions have been finalised based on initial research. Additional refinements may be made based on workflow analysis and testing:

1. **Primary File Naming Convention**
	- **Standard:** kebab-case (hyphen-delimited)
	- Example: `project-name-document-v01.pdf`
	- Rationale: Best balance of readability, URL compatibility, and automation support

2. **Date Format**
	- **Standard:** ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD)
	- Example: `project-meeting-notes-20250301.md`
	- Rationale: Ensures chronological sorting and international compatibility

3. **Version Numbering**
	- **Standard:** v01, v02 format with leading zeros
	- Example: `presentation-client-v03.pptx`
	- Rationale: Maintains correct sorting order in file listings

4. **Special Character Policy**
	- **Prohibited:** `!@#$%^&*()=+[]{};:'"\|,/<>?`
	- **Allowed:** hyphens, periods (for specific uses)
	- Rationale: Ensures cross-platform compatibility and URL-friendliness

5. **Specific File Type Templates** (To be refined through testing)
	a. **Documents**

	```
	[project]-[type]-[descriptor]-[YYYYMMDD]-v[##].[ext]
	```

	Example: `fomo-report-quarterly-20250301-v02.pdf`
	
	b. **Screenshots**
	
	```
	screenshot-[device]-[context]-[YYYYMMDD]-[HHMMSS].[ext]
	```
	
	Example: `screenshot-macbook-safari-20250301-143022.png`
	
	c. **Design Assets**
	
	```
	[project]-[asset-type]-[descriptor]-v[##].[ext]
	```
	
	Example: `fomo-logo-dark-v03.svg`
	
	d. **Code Files**
	
	```
	[function/purpose]-[language].[ext]
	```
	
	Example: `file-renamer.py`
   
## 7. Automation Approach

2. **Apple Shortcuts**
	- Quick renaming of selected files
	- Capture and process screenshots
	- Standardise naming on save dialogs
	- Build file processing workflows

3. **Scripts (Python, AppleScript and other)**
